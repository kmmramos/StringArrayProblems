# StringArrayProblems

This is to provide brute force solutions and optimal solutions for the following string array problems.

Problem One:
Given two strings S & T, return if they are equal when both are typed out. Any "#" that appears in the string count as a backspace.

Problem Two:
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Problem Three:
Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome.

Problem Four:
Given a string, determine if it is almost a palindrome. A string is almost a palindrome if it becomes a palindrome by removing 1 letter. Consider only alphanumeric characters and ignore case sensitivity.

Problem Five:
Stack token exchange problem where 2 tokens can be exchanged into 1 token. You must find the remaining number of tokens after any number of exchange operations.

Problem Six: 
Find the smallest integer greater than the given number that does not have two consecutive identical digits.
